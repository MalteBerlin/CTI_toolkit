# Firebase
This is the project for receiving data from the Segger sensor board.
This application allows a user to login to a firebase authentification system
Once passed this the user has access to viewing live data, stored data and pulling and pushing data to the server.

The live data feature enables the user in real time to look at advertisement packets that the segger board is broadcasting for the user to see. This will also have the feature of communicating with the board.

The store feature enables the user to filter the data that is stored on the mobile application and then push that data to the server.
This data can then be pulled from the server.
